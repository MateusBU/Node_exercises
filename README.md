## Modules used
- **Loadash**: Function to use random numbers
- **nodemon**: Module to use while debug the code. It refreshes and the code changes. 'rs' restarts;
-- **Body Parser**: Node.js middleware that parses incoming request bodies (like JSON or URL-encoded data). It can can be easily accessed via `req.body`.
## Commands

- **npm init -y**: create package.json
- **npm start**: run the file from package.json (script.start). As noe file '.js' is being pointed, the code runs the file '.js' from main
- **npm run dev**: In this case, it happens the same of `npm start`. But it is possible to do in another way.
